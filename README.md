## Overview

The `@espressif/rainmaker-base-sdk` package is designed to accelerate app development by providing a unified API for interacting with the ESP Rainmaker platform. With support for different communication transports, developers can seamlessly integrate features such as provisioning, device control, and discovery into their apps.

The SDK provides:

- Native module support with adapter interfaces for iOS and Android.
- Support for various transport modes (currently local and cloud).
- A modular design with separate modules for user management, device management, and group management.

## Key Features

## Usage

### User Login Usage Example

Below is a step-by-step guide to logging in a user using the `@espressif/rainmaker-base-sdk` SDK:

1. **Import the SDK**

   Begin by importing the `ESPRMBase` class from the `@espressif/rainmaker-base-sdk` package.

   ```javascript
   import { ESPRMBase } from "@espressif/rainmaker-base-sdk";
   ```

2. **Configure the SDK**

   Use the `configure` method to initialize the SDK with the required base URL and API version.

   ```javascript
   ESPRMBase.configure({
     baseUrl: "https://api.rainmaker.espressif.com",
     version: "v1",
   });
   ```

3. **Get an Instance of the Authentication Module**

   Obtain an instance of the authentication module by calling `getAuthInstance()` on the `ESPRMBase` class.

   ```javascript
   const authInstance = ESPRMBase.getAuthInstance();
   ```

4. **Attempt User Login**

   Call the `login` method on the authentication instance, passing the username and password as arguments.
   Handle the response or any potential errors using a try-catch block.

   ```javascript
   try {
     const resp = await authInstance.login("<USERNAME>", "<PASSWORD>");
     console.log(resp); // Log the response on successful login
   } catch (error) {
     console.log(error); // Handle and log any errors during login
   }
   ```

5. **Review the Login Response**

   The `login` method returns a promise. On successful resolution, it provides the user's instance.
   Ensure you properly log or handle the response in your application.
